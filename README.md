# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

monty_hall_sim is a brute-force method of determining the optimal strategy for the Monty Hall Problem.

# Usage
1. Set boolean SWITCH_CHOICE to ```True``` (default) or ```False```.
   - ```True``` represents the player choosing to switch from their initial selection to another door when given the chance.
   - ```False``` represents the player choosing to keep their inital selection when given the chance.
2. Run ```main.py``` 

When run, main.py will output the approximate probability of winning a car with the choice that you made (keep door, or switch door).
